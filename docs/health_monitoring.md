Biometric data is collected using IoT devices that monitor various health indicators, including:

- **Iris Scans**: Used for biometric authentication and potential detection of health conditions.
- **Heartbeat and Respiration Patterns**: Monitored to detect irregularities that could indicate health issues.
- **Pupil Dilation and Vasculature Changes**: Analyzed for signs of neurological conditions or stress.

## Data Processing

The collected data is processed using advanced algorithms that analyze patterns and detect anomalies. If any potential health risks are identified, users are notified and advised to consult a healthcare professional.

## Security and Privacy

All health data is encrypted using quantum-safe encryption techniques to ensure privacy and security. Users have full control over their data and can choose to share it with healthcare providers.

## Conclusion

The health monitoring feature of the Citizen Voting Platform aims to provide early detection and prevention of health issues, enhancing the overall wellbeing of its users.
