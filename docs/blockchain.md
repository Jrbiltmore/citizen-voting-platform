# Blockchain Integration for the Citizen Voting Platform

## Overview

The Citizen Voting Platform uses blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and immutable voting. The Ethereum blockchain is utilized to record votes, providing a public ledger that is resistant to tampering and fraud.

## Smart Contracts

### VotingContract

The VotingContract is the core smart contract responsible for recording and verifying votes. Key functions include:

- `recordVote`: Records a user's vote on the blockchain. Requires the user's signature and the bill ID.
- `verifyVote`: Allows users to verify that their vote has been correctly recorded on the blockchain.
- `getVotes`: Retrieves all votes for a specific bill ID.

## Security Features

- **Decentralization**: By using a decentralized network, the platform ensures that no single entity controls the vote recording process.
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, votes cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the voting process.
- **Transparency**: The public ledger allows anyone to view the recorded votes, providing transparency and trust in the system.

## Deployment

Smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. For testing purposes, they can be deployed on the Ropsten testnet.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Compile Smart Contracts**: Use the Solidity compiler to compile the smart contracts into bytecode.
2. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy the compiled contracts to the Ethereum network using a deployment script or tool like Truffle.
3. **Verify Contracts**: Verify the deployed contracts on Etherscan to ensure they match the source code.

## Conclusion

Blockchain technology is a critical component of the Citizen Voting Platform, providing the security and transparency needed for a trustworthy voting process. Regular audits and updates ensure the smart contracts remain secure and functional.
