## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Voting**: Transparent and immutable voting process using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure user authentication through iris scans, heartbeat patterns, and other biometric data.
- **Quantum-Safe Encryption**: Protects user data with advanced encryption methods that are resistant to future quantum computing threats.
- **Health Monitoring**: Integrated IoT devices to monitor health data, providing early detection of potential health issues.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Web, mobile, and IoT compatibility with seamless integration across devices.
