# Deployment Guide for the Citizen Voting Platform

## Overview

The Citizen Voting Platform can be deployed in various environments, including local development, staging, and production. This guide provides instructions for deploying the platform using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

## Local Development

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/citizen-voting-platform.git
   ```

2. **Setup Environment Variables**: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the necessary environment variables.

3. **Run Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to build and start the application.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Staging and Production

### Deploying to AWS

1. **Create AWS Resources**: Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to create necessary AWS resources, including EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.

2. **Configure AWS CLI**: Ensure the AWS CLI is configured with appropriate credentials.
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Deploy Docker Containers**: Use AWS ECS or EKS to deploy Docker containers for the backend, frontend, and database.

4. **Setup Load Balancer**: Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to the appropriate containers.

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Install Kubernetes Tools**: Ensure `kubectl` and `helm` are installed on your machine.

2. **Deploy to Kubernetes Cluster**: Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service files to your cluster.
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/service.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**: Use `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl logs` to monitor the deployment status.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **GitHub Actions**: Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- **Jenkins**: Alternatively, use Jenkins pipelines to manage the build, test, and deploy process.

## Conclusion
