# System Architecture for the Citizen Voting Platform

## Overview

The Citizen Voting Platform is a secure, decentralized system that allows American citizens and residents to vote on bills, policies, and legislative actions. The platform is built with a microservices architecture, integrating web, mobile, and IoT applications with blockchain, quantum-safe encryption, biometric authentication, and health monitoring.

## Components

### 1. Backend

The backend is built using Python and Flask, providing RESTful APIs for the frontend and mobile applications. It integrates with a PostgreSQL database and Ethereum blockchain for data storage and vote recording.

### 2. Frontend

The frontend is a React-based web application providing a user interface for registration, voting, and viewing health data.

### 3. Mobile Application

The mobile application is developed using React Native, providing a seamless voting experience on iOS and Android devices.

### 4. IoT Integration

The IoT integration allows smart devices to collect and transmit biometric and health data, enhancing user authentication and monitoring.

### 5. Blockchain

The blockchain component uses Ethereum smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent, and immutable vote recording.

### 6. Security

The platform employs quantum-safe encryption and biometric authentication to protect user data and ensure secure access.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**: Users register by providing biometric data, which is securely stored and hashed.
2. **Voting**: Registered users can cast votes, which are recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Health Monitoring**: IoT devices collect health data, which is analyzed to detect potential health issues.

## Deployment

The platform is deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and high availability.
